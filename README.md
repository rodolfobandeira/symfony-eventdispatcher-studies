**Results:**

The idea was successfully achieved. Two events was registred as a service on the application. 
First we can see the event `LoadMyPage` executed.

The second event is responsible to change the object and send it back to the controller. It was a 
kind of hack injecting a new value to the object through events every time it' dispached. 

Really cool stuff!


output:

```
LoadMyPage event was dispatched!

ChangeMyObject event dispatched!

array:2 [â–¼
  0 => "Hi! This is my value before the event touch me!"
  1 => "Rodolfo Bandeira is the new value!"
]
```
